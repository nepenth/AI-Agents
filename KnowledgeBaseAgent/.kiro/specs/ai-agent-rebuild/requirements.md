# AI Agent Rebuild - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves rebuilding the Knowledge Base AI Agent system from scratch, separating it into two distinct projects: a modern backend API service and a contemporary frontend application. The rebuild aims to create a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture that preserves the core functionality while modernizing the technology stack and improving the user experience.

The system processes content from various sources (primarily Twitter/X bookmarks), uses AI to categorize and enhance the content, generates knowledge base items, creates synthesis documents, and provides an interactive chat interface for querying the knowledge base.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend API Service Architecture

5. WHEN the backend manages data THEN it SHALL use a unified database schema with proper ORM patterns
6. WHEN the backend processes AI requests THEN it SHALL support multiple inference backends (Ollama, LocalAI, OpenAI-compatible APIs)
7. WHEN the backend handles errors THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive error handling with structured logging
8. WHEN the backend is deployed THEN it SHALL be containerized with Docker for easy deployment

### Requirement 2: Frontend Application Architecture
