# AI Agent Rebuild - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves rebuilding the Knowledge Base AI Agent system from scratch, separating it into two distinct projects: a modern backend API service and a contemporary frontend application. The rebuild aims to create a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture that preserves the core functionality while modernizing the technology stack and improving the user experience.

The system processes content from various sources (primarily Twitter/X bookmarks), uses AI to categorize and enhance the content, generates knowledge base items, creates synthesis documents, and provides an interactive chat interface for querying the knowledge base.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend API Service Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a modern, scalable backend API service that handles all AI processing, data management, and business logic, so that the system can be easily maintained, tested, and scaled independently.

5. WHEN the backend manages data THEN it SHALL use a unified database schema with proper ORM patterns
6. WHEN the backend processes AI requests THEN it SHALL support multiple inference backends (Ollama, LocalAI, OpenAI-compatible APIs)
7. WHEN the backend handles errors THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive error handling with structured logging
8. WHEN the backend is deployed THEN it SHALL be containerized with Docker for easy deployment

### Requirement 2: Frontend Application Architecture

7. WHEN content is exported THEN the system SHALL generate markdown files and maintain file-based backups
8. WHEN content is versioned THEN the system SHALL track changes and maintain content history

### Requirement 5: AI Chat Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intelligent chat interface that can answer questions about my knowledge base using AI, so that I can quickly find information and get insights from my collected content.
