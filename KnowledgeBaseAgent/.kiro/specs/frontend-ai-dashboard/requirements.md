3. WHEN I configure a model THEN the system SHALL validate model availability and capabilities
4. WHEN I save configuration THEN the system SHALL test the model connection and confirm functionality
5. WHEN models are unavailable THEN the system SHALL show fallback options and warnings
6. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL update the backend settings via API

### Requirement 3: Tweet Processing Dashboard

**User Story:** As a content analyst, I want to process individual tweets and see detailed AI analysis results, so that I can understand the quality and accuracy of AI processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter a tweet ID THEN the system SHALL fetch real tweet data from Twitter API
2. WHEN processing starts THEN the system SHALL show each sub-phase with detailed progress
3. WHEN media analysis runs THEN the system SHALL display vision model results for images/videos
4. WHEN content understanding runs THEN the system SHALL show AI-generated insights and categorization
5. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL compare AI results with Twitter's context annotations
6. WHEN I view results THEN the system SHALL highlight differences between real AI and simulated processing

### Requirement 4: Knowledge Base Browser

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to browse and search processed content in the knowledge base, so that I can explore categorized tweets and their AI analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the knowledge base THEN the system SHALL display categorized content with AI-generated categories
2. WHEN I search content THEN the system SHALL use vector embeddings for semantic search
3. WHEN I view a tweet THEN the system SHALL show original content, AI analysis, and processing metadata
4. WHEN I filter by category THEN the system SHALL show AI-generated vs Twitter-provided categorizations
5. WHEN I view thread content THEN the system SHALL display collective understanding and thread analysis
6. WHEN I export data THEN the system SHALL provide processed content in multiple formats

### Requirement 5: System Monitoring and Performance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor AI model performance and pipeline metrics, so that I can optimize system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access monitoring THEN the system SHALL display real-time pipeline status and active tasks
2. WHEN I view metrics THEN the system SHALL show AI model response times and success rates
3. WHEN I check system health THEN the system SHALL display database, AI service, and API connectivity status
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with stack traces
5. WHEN I view usage statistics THEN the system SHALL show processing volume and performance trends
6. WHEN I need diagnostics THEN the system SHALL provide tools to test individual AI models and phases

### Requirement 6: WebSocket Real-Time Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive real-time updates during processing, so that I can see immediate feedback without refreshing the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing starts THEN the system SHALL establish WebSocket connection for real-time updates
2. WHEN phase status changes THEN the system SHALL immediately update the UI without page refresh
3. WHEN AI processing occurs THEN the system SHALL stream progress updates and intermediate results
4. WHEN multiple users are active THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to all connected clients
5. WHEN connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection and show connection status
6. WHEN updates are received THEN the system SHALL animate transitions and highlight changes

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and recovery options when processing fails, so that I can understand issues and retry processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI models are unavailable THEN the system SHALL show clear warnings and fallback options
2. WHEN Twitter API fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and retry options
3. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL show which phase failed and why
4. WHEN I encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recovery steps
5. WHEN I retry processing THEN the system SHALL resume from the failed phase or restart completely
6. WHEN errors persist THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 8: Mobile-Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to access the dashboard on mobile devices, so that I can monitor processing and view results on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout
2. WHEN I view pipeline status THEN the system SHALL show condensed but complete information
3. WHEN I interact with controls THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly interfaces
4. WHEN I view results THEN the system SHALL format content appropriately for small screens
5. WHEN I use the dashboard THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality across device sizes
6. WHEN I rotate the device THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately

### Requirement 9: Data Export and Integration

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to export processed data and integrate with external tools, so that I can perform additional analysis and reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I export data THEN the system SHALL provide multiple formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown)
2. WHEN I download results THEN the system SHALL include all AI analysis and metadata
3. WHEN I use APIs THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful endpoints for programmatic access
