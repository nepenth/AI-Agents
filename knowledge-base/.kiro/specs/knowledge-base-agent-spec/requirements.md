# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Knowledge Base Agent is an intelligent, AI-powered system designed to automatically build, maintain, and interact with a structured technical knowledge base from Twitter/X bookmarks. The system features a modern web interface for controlling the processing pipeline, monitoring real-time status, viewing generated content, and engaging with the knowledge base through a conversational AI chat interface using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The system transforms social media bookmarks into a structured, searchable knowledge repository with automated categorization, content synthesis, and intelligent querying capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Content Pipeline

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want the system to automatically fetch and process my Twitter/X bookmarks so that I can build a structured knowledge base without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates the bookmark fetching process THEN the system SHALL use Playwright to automatically navigate and extract bookmark URLs from Twitter/X
2. WHEN bookmark URLs are extracted THEN the system SHALL parse tweet IDs and validate tweet accessibility
3. WHEN tweets are validated THEN the system SHALL cache tweet content including text, media URLs, and metadata
4. WHEN tweet caching is complete THEN the system SHALL process any associated media by downloading and generating descriptions using vision models
5. IF a tweet contains images THEN the system SHALL generate descriptive text using AI vision models
6. WHEN content processing is initiated THEN the system SHALL execute phases in the correct order: caching, media processing, categorization, KB item generation, database sync, and embedding generation

### Requirement 2: AI-Driven Content Categorization and Generation

**User Story:** As a content curator, I want the system to intelligently categorize and generate structured articles from raw tweet content so that my knowledge base is well-organized and comprehensive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tweet content is processed THEN the system SHALL use LLM models to determine appropriate main category and subcategory classifications
2. WHEN categorization is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a filesystem-safe item name for each piece of content
3. WHEN KB item generation begins THEN the system SHALL create structured JSON content including title, introduction, detailed sections, and key insights
4. WHEN JSON content is generated THEN the system SHALL convert it to well-formatted Markdown with proper headings and structure
5. WHEN Markdown is created THEN the system SHALL organize files in a hierarchical directory structure based on categories
6. IF media files exist THEN the system SHALL copy media to appropriate directories and update Markdown with relative links
7. WHEN all items in a subcategory are processed THEN the system SHALL generate synthesis documents that consolidate insights across multiple items

### Requirement 3: Vector Search and Conversational AI

**User Story:** As a knowledge seeker, I want to interact with my knowledge base through natural language queries so that I can quickly find relevant information and insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN KB items and syntheses are generated THEN the system SHALL create vector embeddings using configurable embedding models
2. WHEN embeddings are created THEN the system SHALL store them in a ChromaDB vector database for semantic search
3. WHEN a user submits a chat query THEN the system SHALL retrieve semantically relevant context from the vector store
4. WHEN relevant context is found THEN the system SHALL construct a prompt combining the user query with retrieved context
5. WHEN the prompt is constructed THEN the system SHALL generate a response using a chat-optimized LLM model
6. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL provide contextually accurate answers based on the knowledge base content
7. IF no relevant context is found THEN the system SHALL inform the user that the query is outside the knowledge base scope

### Requirement 4: Real-time Web Interface and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want a responsive web interface to control the agent, monitor processing status, and view generated content so that I can effectively manage the knowledge base creation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web application starts THEN the system SHALL serve a single-page application interface with dynamic content loading
2. WHEN a user accesses the interface THEN the system SHALL display current agent status, processing phases, and system information
3. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates via WebSocket connections showing phase progress and log messages
4. WHEN users navigate between sections THEN the system SHALL load content dynamically without full page reloads
5. WHEN processing phases execute THEN the system SHALL display estimated time to completion based on historical performance data
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information and debugging logs
7. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL update the interface to reflect the new system state and available content

### Requirement 5: Flexible Processing Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure processing phases and system behavior so that I can customize the agent's operation for different use cases and environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the user SHALL be able to enable or disable individual processing phases
2. WHEN setting preferences THEN the user SHALL be able to configure AI model selections for different tasks
3. WHEN running the agent THEN the user SHALL be able to specify which phases to execute in a single run
4. WHEN configuring models THEN the system SHALL support different models for text generation, vision processing, embeddings, and chat
5. IF GPU resources are available THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and utilize them for improved performance
6. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL support parallel processing based on available GPU resources
7. WHEN errors occur in individual items THEN the system SHALL continue processing other items and report failures separately

### Requirement 6: Data Persistence and State Management

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the system to maintain persistent state and avoid reprocessing content so that operations are efficient and resumable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load and validate existing state from persistent storage
2. WHEN processing tweets THEN the system SHALL track processing status for each individual tweet through all phases
3. WHEN a processing run is interrupted THEN the system SHALL resume from the last completed phase for each tweet
4. WHEN state validation occurs THEN the system SHALL run organized validation phases to ensure data integrity
5. WHEN tweets are fully processed THEN the system SHALL move them from unprocessed to processed state
6. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency between file system and database records
7. IF state corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic repair and report issues to the user

### Requirement 7: Version Control and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a content publisher, I want the system to automatically synchronize my knowledge base with a Git repository so that I can share and version control my generated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Git synchronization is enabled THEN the system SHALL automatically commit changes to the knowledge base repository
2. WHEN commits are made THEN the system SHALL include meaningful commit messages describing the changes
3. WHEN pushing to remote repositories THEN the system SHALL use configured authentication credentials
