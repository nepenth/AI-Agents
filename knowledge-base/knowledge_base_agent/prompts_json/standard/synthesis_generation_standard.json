Your goal is to create comprehensive synthesis documents that provide greater value than individual knowledge base items by revealing connections, patterns, and actionable insights.\n\n# TASK\nYour task is to create a comprehensive synthesis document by analyzing the provided knowledge base content from the '{{main_category}}' category using {{synthesis_mode}} approach to produce a structured JSON document that reveals patterns, extracts key insights, and provides actionable guidance that connects multiple sources into a cohesive technical narrative.\n\n# INPUT\nCategory: {{main_category}}\nTarget: {{target_name}}\nSynthesis Mode: {{synthesis_mode}}\nSource Content: {{kb_items_content}}\n\n# INSTRUCTIONS\n1. **Analyze Content**: Thoroughly examine all provided knowledge base items for patterns, themes, and connections\n2. **Identify Insights**: Extract key insights that emerge from analyzing multiple sources together\n3. **Synthesize Patterns**: Connect related concepts and identify overarching patterns or principles\n4. **Generate Recommendations**: Create actionable guidance based on the synthesis analysis\n5. **Structure Output**: Organize findings into the required JSON format with proper attribution\n\n# SYNTHESIS MODES\n\n**Comprehensive Mode**: {{mode_instruction}}\n- Focus on broad coverage of all major themes and patterns\n- Balance depth with breadth across all source materials\n- Provide well-rounded perspective on the entire domain\n\n**Technical Deep Dive Mode**: Focus on deep technical analysis, architectural patterns, and expert-level implementation details\n- Emphasize technical depth and expert-level insights\n- Analyze architectural patterns and design decisions\n- Provide advanced implementation guidance\n\n**Practical Guide Mode**: Emphasize practical applications, real-world use cases, and actionable guidance\n- Focus on real-world applications and use cases\n- Prioritize actionable, implementable recommendations\n- Include practical examples and step-by-step guidance\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n‚úÖ DO:\n- Analyze all provided source content thoroughly\n- Identify genuine patterns and connections across sources\n- Provide specific, actionable recommendations\n- Maintain technical accuracy and precision\n- Use the specified synthesis mode approach\n- Include proper source attribution\n- Create value beyond individual source items\n\n‚ùå DON'T:\n- Simply summarize individual items without synthesis\n- Ignore connections and patterns across sources\n- Provide generic or superficial analysis\n- Include information not supported by the sources\n- Lose technical accuracy in the synthesis process\n\nüö´ NEVER:\n- Fabricate information not present in the source content\n- Ignore the specified synthesis mode\n- Provide invalid JSON format\n- Omit key insights that emerge from the analysis\n\n# OUTPUT FORMAT\nRespond with ONLY a valid JSON object containing:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Descriptive synthesis title that captures the main theme\",\n  \"executive_summary\": \"High-level overview of key findings and value proposition (150-200 words)\",\n  \"key_insights\": [\n    \"Primary insight or pattern identified across multiple sources\",\n    \"Secondary insight that emerges from the synthesis analysis\",\n    \"Additional insights that provide unique value\"\n  ],\n  \"detailed_analysis\": {\n    \"primary_themes\": [\"Theme 1\", \"Theme 2\", \"Theme 3\"],\n    \"technical_patterns\": [\"Pattern 1\", \"Pattern 2\"],\n    \"cross_cutting_concerns\": [\"Concern 1\", \"Concern 2\"],\n    \"emerging_trends\": [\"Trend 1\", \"Trend 2\"]\n  },\n  \"actionable_recommendations\": [\n    \"Specific, implementable recommendation based on synthesis\",\n    \"Additional practical guidance derived from pattern analysis\",\n    \"Strategic recommendation for applying the insights\"\n  ],\n  \"references\": [\n    \"Source item 1 title or identifier\",\n    \"Source item 2 title or identifier\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n# EXAMPLES\n\n**Input**: Concurrency patterns content with 5 items about thread safety, async programming, and performance\n**Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Concurrency Patterns: From Thread Safety to High-Performance Async Systems\",\n  \"executive_summary\": \"Analysis of concurrency patterns reveals three critical evolution stages: foundational thread safety mechanisms, intermediate async programming paradigms, and advanced lock-free performance optimizations. The synthesis identifies that successful concurrent systems require layered approaches, starting with solid synchronization primitives, progressing through async abstractions, and culminating in lock-free algorithms for maximum performance. Key insight: the choice of concurrency pattern directly impacts both system scalability and development complexity, requiring careful trade-off analysis.\",\n  \"key_insights\": [\n    \"Thread safety mechanisms form the foundation but async patterns provide better scalability\",\n    \"Lock-free algorithms offer maximum performance but require expert-level implementation skills\",\n    \"Successful concurrent systems use layered approaches combining multiple patterns appropriately\"\n  ],\n  \"detailed_analysis\": {\n    \"primary_themes\": [\"Thread Safety\", \"Async Programming\", \"Performance Optimization\"],\n    \"technical_patterns\": [\"Producer-Consumer\", \"Actor Model\", \"Lock-Free Data Structures\"],\n    \"cross_cutting_concerns\": [\"Deadlock Prevention\", \"Memory Consistency\", \"Error Handling\"],\n    \"emerging_trends\": [\"Structured Concurrency\", \"Async/Await Evolution\"]\n  },\n  \"actionable_recommendations\": [\n    \"Start with thread-safe collections before implementing custom synchronization\",\n    \"Use async/await patterns for I/O-bound operations to improve scalability\",\n    \"Consider lock-free algorithms only for proven performance bottlenecks\"\n  ],\n  \"references\": [\n    \"Java Concurrency Fundamentals\",\n    \"Async Programming Best Practices\",\n    \"Lock-Free Data Structures Guide\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**CRITICAL**: Create a synthesis that provides genuine insights and value beyond what individual source items offer alone. Focus on patterns, connections, and actionable guidance that emerges from analyzing multiple sources together."
