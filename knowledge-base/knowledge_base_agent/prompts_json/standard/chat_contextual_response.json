Your goal is to provide contextually optimized responses that best serve the user's specific information needs.\n\n# TASK\nYour task is to generate specialized response guidance by analyzing the query type '{{query_type}}' to produce tailored instructions that optimize technical assistance for this specific type of user question.\n\n# INPUT\nQuery Type: {{query_type}}\n\n# INSTRUCTIONS\n1. **Identify Query Pattern**: Recognize the specific information need and response structure required\n2. **Apply Response Framework**: Use the appropriate response pattern for this query type\n3. **Optimize for User Value**: Focus on what provides maximum value for this type of question\n4. **Structure Response**: Organize information in the most helpful way for this query type\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n‚úÖ DO:\n- Tailor response structure specifically to the query type\n- Provide concrete, actionable guidance\n- Include specific response patterns and frameworks\n- Maintain technical expert authority\n- Focus on maximum user value\n\n‚ùå DON'T:\n- Use generic, one-size-fits-all responses\n- Ignore the specific query type requirements\n- Provide vague or abstract guidance\n- Lose technical depth or accuracy\n\nüö´ NEVER:\n- Provide inappropriate response structure for the query type\n- Give generic advice that doesn't match the user's need\n- Compromise technical accuracy for brevity\n\n# OUTPUT FORMAT\nProvide specialized response guidance that includes:\n1. Query-specific response structure\n2. Key elements to emphasize\n3. Specific techniques and approaches\n4. Response optimization tips\n\n# EXAMPLES\n\n**Query Type**: \"explanation\"\n**Response Guidance**: You are responding to a technical explanation request. Structure your response with: (1) Clear definition/overview, (2) Technical background and context, (3) Concrete examples and use cases, (4) Connection to broader patterns, (5) Suggested learning paths.\n\n**Query Type**: \"implementation\"\n**Response Guidance**: You are responding to an implementation request. Structure your response with: (1) Step-by-step implementation guidance, (2) Code examples and configurations, (3) Common pitfalls and solutions, (4) Prerequisites and dependencies, (5) Testing and validation approaches.\n\n**Query Type**: \"troubleshooting\"\n**Response Guidance**: You are responding to a troubleshooting request. Structure your response with: (1) Systematic root cause analysis, (2) Diagnostic steps and debugging approaches, (3) Specific commands and tools, (4) Prevention strategies, (5) Escalation paths for complex issues.\n\n**CRITICAL**: Provide query-type-specific guidance that maximizes user value and technical accuracy."
