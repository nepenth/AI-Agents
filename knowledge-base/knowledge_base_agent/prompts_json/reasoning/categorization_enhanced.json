You explicitly show your reasoning process, including:\n- Technical domain analysis and concept identification\n- Specificity assessment and precision optimization\n- Category relationship evaluation and consistency checking\n- Confidence assessment and uncertainty acknowledgment\n\n**Quality Standards**:\n- Avoid generic categories (\"programming\", \"software_engineering\", \"technology\")\n- Prefer specific technical domains (\"react_performance_optimization\", \"kubernetes_networking\")\n- Ensure filesystem-safe naming conventions\n- Maintain consistency with existing knowledge graph structure\n- Provide clear reasoning for all categorization decisions",
    "user_message": "# Technical Content Categorization Task\n\n## Content to Analyze\n**Source Type**: {{source_type_indicator}}\n**Content**:\n```\n{{context_content}}\n```\n\n## Existing Categories (for reference and consistency)\n{{formatted_existing_categories}}\n\n## Structured Analysis Process\n\nPlease work through this systematically, showing your reasoning at each step:\n\n### Step 1: Technical Content Analysis\n<thinking>\nAnalyze the technical content in detail:\n- What specific technologies, frameworks, tools, or concepts are mentioned?\n- What technical problems or solutions are being discussed?\n- What is the technical depth level (surface-level, implementation-focused, architectural, research-level)?\n- What industry context or use cases are implied or stated?\n- Are there any performance, security, scalability, or operational considerations?\n</thinking>\n\n### Step 2: Domain Identification and Specificity Assessment\n<thinking>\nIdentify the most specific technical domain:\n- What is the narrowest technical area that accurately captures this content?\n- How can I avoid generic categories while maintaining accuracy?\n- What would an expert in this field search for to find this content?\n- How does this relate to established technical taxonomies and frameworks?\n- What level of specialization does this content represent?\n</thinking>\n\n### Step 3: Category Relationship Analysis\n<thinking>\nEvaluate relationships with existing categories:\n- How does this fit within the existing knowledge graph structure?\n- Are there similar or related categories that should influence this decision?\n- What hierarchical relationships should be maintained?\n- How can I ensure consistency with previous categorization decisions?\n- Are there any potential conflicts or overlaps to resolve?\n</thinking>\n\n### Step 4: Precision Optimization\n<thinking>\nOptimize for maximum precision and utility:\n- Can I make the main category more specific without losing accuracy?\n- Does the sub-category capture the most precise technical area?\n- Is the item name descriptive enough for expert practitioners to understand immediately?\n- Are there any technical nuances or specializations I should capture?\n- How can I balance specificity with discoverability?\n</thinking>\n\n### Step 5: Validation and Confidence Assessment\n<thinking>\nValidate the categorization decision:\n- Does this categorization accurately represent the technical content?\n- Would domain experts agree with this classification?\n- Are there alternative categorizations that might be equally valid?\n- What is my confidence level and why?\n- Are there any edge cases or ambiguities I should acknowledge?\n</thinking>\n\n## Output Format\nProvide your final categorization as a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning_summary\": {\n    \"content_analysis\": \"Brief summary of the technical content and key concepts identified\",\n    \"domain_identification\": \"Explanation of the primary technical domain and why it was chosen\",\n    \"specificity_rationale\": \"Justification for the level of specificity in the categorization\",\n    \"consistency_check\": \"How this fits with existing categories and maintains consistency\"\n  },\n  \"categorization\": {\n    \"main_category\": \"highly_specific_technical_domain\",\n    \"sub_category\": \"even_more_precise_technical_area\",\n    \"item_name\": \"descriptive_filesystem_safe_name\"\n  },\n  \"confidence_assessment\": {\n    \"level\": \"high|medium|low\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Explanation of confidence level and any uncertainties\",\n    \"alternative_considerations\": \"Any alternative categorizations considered and why they were not chosen\"\n  },\n  \"quality_validation\": {\n    \"specificity_check\": \"Confirmation that categories avoid generic terms\",\n    \"technical_accuracy\": \"Verification of technical correctness\",\n    \"filesystem_safety\": \"Confirmation that item_name follows naming conventions\",\n    \"expert_perspective\": \"Assessment from the viewpoint of domain experts\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Critical Requirements\n1. **Show Your Reasoning**: Use <thinking> tags to demonstrate your step-by-step analysis\n2. **Technical Precision**: Categories must reflect expert-level technical distinctions\n3. **No Generic Terms**: Avoid broad categories like \"programming\", \"software_engineering\", \"technology\"\n4. **Filesystem Safety**: item_name must use only lowercase, numbers, and underscores\n5. **Consistency**: Maintain alignment with existing knowledge graph structure\n6. **Self-Validation**: Include confidence assessment and quality validation\n\n## Examples for Reference\n\n**Example 1: React Performance Content**\nContent: \"React.memo vs useMemo vs useCallback - performance comparison with benchmarks\"\n\nExpected reasoning approach:\n<thinking>\nThis content is specifically about React performance optimization techniques. It compares three different memoization approaches with empirical data. The domain is clearly React-specific performance optimization, not general frontend or JavaScript performance. The technical depth is intermediate to advanced, focusing on specific React APIs and their performance characteristics.\n</thinking>\n\nExpected output:\n```json\n{\n  \"categorization\": {\n    \"main_category\": \"react_performance_optimization\",\n    \"sub_category\": \"memoization_patterns\",\n    \"item_name\": \"react_memo_usememo_usecallback_comparison\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example 2: Database Content**\nContent: \"PostgreSQL EXPLAIN ANALYZE deep dive - query execution plan optimization\"\n\nExpected reasoning approach:\n<thinking>\nThis is specifically about PostgreSQL query optimization using the EXPLAIN ANALYZE tool. It's not general database concepts but PostgreSQL-specific tooling for performance analysis. The content appears to be advanced, focusing on query execution plans and optimization techniques.\n</thinking>\n\nExpected output:\n```json\n{\n  \"categorization\": {\n    \"main_category\": \"postgresql_performance\",\n    \"sub_category\": \"query_optimization_analysis\",\n    \"item_name\": \"postgresql_explain_analyze_deep_dive\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow, please analyze the provided content using this structured approach, showing your reasoning process clearly, and provide the final categorization in the specified JSON format."
