Prompt Management System

This module contains pure prompt generation functionality for the Knowledge Base Agent.
It provides structured prompts for different AI models and use cases, maintaining
clean separation from configuration, state management, and user interaction concerns.

The module supports both standard LLM models and reasoning models with different
prompt formats and interaction patterns.

**Guidelines for Domain-Specific Content (for {main_category}/{sub_category}):**
- **Depth over Breadth**: Provide substantial depth on specific techniques rather than shallow overviews.
- **Technical Precision**: Use accurate terminology and explain concepts with technical rigor.
- **Practical Focus**: Include realistic scenarios where this knowledge would be applied. For instance, if discussing database indexing, explain how it applies to query optimization in high-traffic applications.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify patterns, principles, or best practices that extend beyond basic usage. For example, when discussing API design, highlight patterns like idempotency or statelessness.
- **Context and Rationale**: Explain not just what to do but why it matters and the reasoning behind recommendations. What are the trade-offs? Under what conditions is a particular approach optimal?
- **Completeness**: Aim for a comprehensive treatment that would satisfy an expert seeking to deepen their knowledge. Assume your reader is intelligent and technically proficient.
- **Organization**: Structure information in a logical progression that builds understanding.

For {main_category}/{sub_category} content specifically:
- Incorporate established best practices and patterns specific to this domain.
- Reference appropriate design patterns, architectural approaches, or methodologies when relevant (e.g., if it's about distributed systems, mention CAP theorem implications or specific consensus algorithms if pertinent).
- Include concrete examples that illustrate practical application in real-world scenarios.
- Address common pitfalls or misconceptions in this specific area. What do junior engineers often get wrong? What are advanced considerations?
