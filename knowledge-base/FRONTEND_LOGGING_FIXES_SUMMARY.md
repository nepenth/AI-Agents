# Frontend Logging and Status Communication Fixes - IMPLEMENTED

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Duplicate Log Messages ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Root Cause**: Both SocketIO and API polling were active simultaneously, processing the same events
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - Created `EventDeduplicator` class with intelligent duplicate detection
  - Implemented `SmartConnectionManager` to choose optimal event source
  - Updated `LiveLogsManager` to use global deduplication system
- **Result**: Duplicate log messages eliminated through content-based deduplication

### 2. Missing Status Information ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Root Cause**: Strict event validation was dropping valid events, inconsistent routing
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Relaxed validation rules in `EnhancedRealtimeManager`
  - Enhanced fallback routing for unknown event types
  - Improved phase status validation to be more flexible
- **Result**: All status updates now reach frontend reliably

### 3. Event Architecture Complexity ‚úÖ IMPROVED
- **Root Cause**: Hybrid architecture with overlapping responsibilities
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Created unified event management system
  - Added comprehensive diagnostics and monitoring
  - Implemented smart connection switching
- **Result**: Simplified architecture with better reliability and debugging
