# Implementation Plan for Knowledge Base Agent

## Overview

The Knowledge Base Agent is an AI-driven system designed to automate the process of fetching, processing, categorizing, and generating content for a structured knowledge base. It primarily focuses on processing tweets from Twitter bookmarks, categorizing them using AI models, and generating markdown content for a knowledge repository. This document details the implementation plan, logical flow, and module functionalities to assist in extending, refining, or understanding the agent's design.

## Objectives

- **Automation**: Automate the fetching of Twitter bookmarks, processing of tweet content, and generation of structured knowledge base items.
- **Categorization**: Use AI models to categorize content into a hierarchical structure of main categories and subcategories.
- **Content Generation**: Generate detailed markdown content for each tweet, including text, media, and metadata.
- **State Management**: Maintain a persistent state to track processed and unprocessed content, avoiding redundant operations.
- **Integration**: Synchronize the knowledge base with a GitHub repository for version control and public access.
- **User Interface**: Provide a web interface for initiating agent runs and monitoring progress.
